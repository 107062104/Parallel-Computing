Precondition:
News for m different regions put in m different files each containing 250 topics containing 40 records each. Suppose 'n' reporters per region.

  -Take out say news 50 topics at random and all records from the ith file (belonging to region i) and put in a newly created jth file (jth reporter belonging to ith region).
  Each reporter
  - has its own file from which it has to read the news.
  - has unsigned long long array of length 250, required for communication between reporters.
  - is concerned only with the reporters of its region.

Every report topic has an ID, and within every topic updates have their values say from 0 to n, there is a timestamp associated with every topic.

Send messages from reporters to editors are of three types:differentiated by msg[0],

  1. Enquiry if any other reporter is working on the same topic.
  2. The report after processing,with time stamp.(Editor will store it in the hashtable)
  3. Message stating that the reporter is exiting.(NumProcesseComplete++)

--->msg[1]and msg[2] contain topic id  i.e topicid = <<<<(msg[1]-'0')*10+msg[2]-'0'>>>>
--->msg[3]and msg[4] would contain update id.
--->msg[5]and msg[6] would contain timestamp.

typedef unsigned long long ull;

Data structure:Editor
  Struct Report{
  //keep track of which all reporters are working on the report.
    ull working;
  //topic of the report.
  char topic[100];
  //array containing updates
    char *updates[15];
  //stores the update time for recentness.
    int timestamp[16];
  };
